README:

The calendar and habit-adding functionality, as well as the bare CSS framework is adapted from "Coding a Calendar App in Plain JavaScript" by PortEXE on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9OSBJaQTlM); corresponding link to the tutorial's Github repo: https://github.com/portexe/VanillaCalendar.

The code was adapted to support our team's mockup appearance and overall functionality. Specifically, the addition/deletion of events was implemented as the addition of new habits and deletion of entries/habits; all other functionality is original code.

Some features may not be fully correct/function as properly intended: the addition of 4+ entries in one day, the proper assignment of colors in entry displays with more than one habit, deleting a habit from an entry.
